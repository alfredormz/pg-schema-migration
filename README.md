# PG Schema Migration

Simple schema migrations for PostgreSQL, which runs pure SQL. Inspired by [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) and [Cassandra Schema](https://github.com/tarolandia/cassandra-schema).

## Installation

```
gem install pg-schema-migration
```

## Usage

PG::Schema uses a DSL via the `PG::Schema.migration` method, a migration must have an `up` block with the changes you want to apply to the schema, and a `down` block reversing the change made by `up`.

### A basic Migration

Use `execute` inside `up` and `down` blocks to run the queries that will modify the schema. Here is a fairly basic `PG::Schema` migration. 

```ruby
PG:Schema.migration do
  up do
    execute <<~SQL
      CREATE TABLE products (
        name VARCHAR(30),
        price NUMERIC
      )
    SQL
    
    execute "CREATE TRIGGER..."
  end
  
  down do
    execute "DROP TABLE products"
    execute "DROP TRIGGER..."
  end
end
```
If there is an error while running a migration, it will rollback the previous schema changes made by the migration.

### Running migrations

```ruby
require 'pg/schema-migration'
require 'pg'

@db = PG.connect(ENV.fetch("DATABASE_URL"))

PG::Schema.migration {...}
PG::Schema.migration {...}

migrator = PG::Schema::Migrator.new(
  db:        @db,                   # a PG connection
  directory: 'path/to/migrations',  # default: nil
  log:       Logger.new('/dev/nul') # default: Logger.new(STDOUT)
)
```
Migrate to the latest version

```ruby
migrator.run!
```
Migrate to an specific version

```ruby
migrator.run!(version: 1)
```
### Migration files

`PG::Schemas::Migrator` expects that each migration file will be in a specific directory. For example:

```ruby
PG::Schema::Migrator.new(db: @conn, directory: 'db/migrations').run!
```

`PG::Schema::Migrator` will look in the `db/migrations` folder relative to the current directory, and run unapplied migrations on the database.

The migration files must be specified as follows:

```bash
version_name.rb
```

where `version` is an integer and `name` is a string which should be a very brief description of what the migration does. Examples:
```bash
001_create_films.rb
002_add_director_to_films.rb
...
015_foo.rb
016_bar.rb
```
